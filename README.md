# Week-1
Attached are the files of my Week 1 task.
The web page I have made is a page which shows us weekly data of Covid-19 cases in Victoria and also has a responsive button which gives us an average of these cases.
I have attached pdf's of :
     1. Html code
     2. CSS code
     3. Javascript code
     4. The web page that has been created using the above mentioned codes
This task helped me get the basics of html, javascript and css and thus made those concepts clealrer for me.
