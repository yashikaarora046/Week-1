# Week-1
Attached are the screenshots of my Week 1 task.
The web page I have made is a page which shows us weekly data of Covid-19 cases in Victoria and also has a responsive button which gives us an average of these cases.
I have attached images of :
     1. Html code
     2. CSS code
     3. Javascript code
     4. The web page that has been created using the above mentioned codes
